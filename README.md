## My process

I started off with the HTML boiler plate, then linked CSS and Bootstrap, and added the Bootstrap card, which I then used CSS and Bootstrap to get the solution.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap Card
- Bootstrap properties.
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Bootstrap properties to customize a bootstrap card. CSS media queries.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on CSS Hover properties, and responsive layouts/mobile-fist workflow.
